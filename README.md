# LaTeX Resume Template

Making a resume in LaTeX can be difficult, and I've found that the hardest part is getting started. 

## FAQ 

### How can I turn a .tex file into a pdf for my resume? 
- If you're just getting started, one option is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), a free online resource. 
- If you want to develop on your computer itself, I personally use [TeXMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), but there are plenty of great options out there. 

### Do you have advice for making a resume? 
- I've posted some of my advice that is more related to formatting on [my personal webiste](http://ethan.schaffer.com/resume-advice/). 
- When it comes to showcasing your skills, I think the most important things are to focus on demonstrating your interest and skills in your target field. A great way to do that is with relevant prior experience, and with personal projects.
